# tomo plugin template

This is a GitHub template for creating [tomo](https://github.com/mattbrictson/tomo) plugins, which are packaged as Ruby gems.

Read the tomo tutorial [Publishing a Plugin](https://tomo-deploy.com/tutorials/publishing-a-plugin/) to get started. Then press [**Use this template**](https://github.com/mattbrictson/tomo-plugin/generate) to generate a project from this template. In the generated project, run this script to rename the gem to meet your needs:

```
ruby rename_template.rb
```

Note that to get the full benefits of the script, you will need the [gh](https://github.com/cli/cli) command installed.

This template is based on `bundle gem` with some notable improvements:

- GitHub Actions configuration
- Minitest, with minitest-reporters for nicely formatted test output
- Rubocop with a good set of configuration
- [release-drafter](https://github.com/apps/release-drafter) GitHub Action for automating release notes
- A `rake bump` task to keep your Ruby and Bundler dependencies up to date
- A nice README with badges ready to go (see below)
